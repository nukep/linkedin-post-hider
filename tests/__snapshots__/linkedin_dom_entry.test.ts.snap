Today I told the office I'd be firing 15% of my staff. I didn't plan on firing a single one. Why did I do it? Because I wanted to create bigger stakes for me entering Battle of the Bands. I told them that if my band wins BotB, then the prize money could ensure everyone keeps their jobs. 6 months ago I couldn't convince a single employee to come support their boss's amateur prog rock band. Suddenly, everyone wanted a ticket. All it took was convincing them their financial livelihood depended on it. The mood was electric. 200 office workers cheering me on. We crashed out immediately. The next day I fired 30 people. You can't create a high stakes narrative and not follow through.",

I told my son that Santa wasn't real. I thought he could handle it. He could not. He started crying and shouting I had ruined his 5th birthday. I tried to tell him I was lying, but he didn't believe me and wanted to go live with Mom. The damage was done. Enter Synthesia . They are running an AI Santa Campaign where you can make a Santa video message for free. If they could produce a lifelike Santa video, my son would believe Santa was real again. I told their AI to generate a Santa that felt as real as possible. I could not believe the result. It felt so indiscernible from reality that even I started believing in Santa again. I'm sending the video below to my son and I have no doubt he will be convinced. My right to child custody is depending on it. hashtag # SynthesiaPartner",

I interviewed a candidate for my Head of HR. For fun, I gave her a Tamagotchi. I wanted to see how she took care of it. After a week I asked her how her Tamagotchi got on. "What Tamagotchi?" She asked. It turned out she left her Tamagotchi at the bottom of her bag and forgot. I hired her on the spot. There's nothing worse than an HR manager who grows attached to the employees. She on the other hand exhibited no empathy whatsoever. The Tamagotchi had depleted hunger and happiness meters, and was covered in its own waste. Perfect. No notes. That's exactly how HR should treat its employees.",

My car broke down on the motorway. Who did I call? Roadside services? Emergency services? My friend with a tow truck? No. I hired a management consultant. Sure, the AA would probably get my car "fixed". But a consultant? They'll find streamlined solutions to implement long term efficiency. I spoke to them for hours. Yes, I was stuck on the side of the road, but I was now stuck on the side of the road with a clear strategy. Consultants fix all my problems. Need a haircut? I call a consultant. Toothache? Consultant. Nausea and diarrhoea? It's consultant o'clock. They've helped cut down my expenses, maintenance costs and medical bills entirely. Which is perfect as I can now afford all this consultancy.",

You won't believe this. I time travelled to the year 2125. 100 years in the future. The world was ravaged by famine, disease and war. Basic resources had become the most sought after commodities. I was shocked. How did this happen? I asked a historian I met at the internment camp. They said World War III could've been prevented by doing one thing. Businesses using the revenue data platform HockeyStack . It was simple. If even a few thousand people used HockeyStack , nuclear war wouldn't have started on January 1st, 2026. I panicked. That's only one month away. I had to get back to my time and spread the word. Save the world. Use HockeyStack . hashtag # HockeyStackPartner",

I tripped on my way leaving work yesterday. I saw my whole life flash before my eyes. All those late nights in the office. Hours making presentation decks. Spending Christmas day working. When I came to, I suddenly thought, is it all worth it? I don't see my kids. I don't have a single hobby. All I do is hustle. Maybe there's more to life than endless work. Maybe I should quit. They sent me to hospital and found I had major internal bleeding. After surgery, I realised I was being a fool. What complete nonsense. Work is amazing and the only reason I'm alive. That was the haemmorage talking.",

I tried to crash the B2Believe LinkedIn event in London yesterday. The upstairs area of Picturehouse Central was booked out for this event. I stood in front of the registration desk for an hour, posing like my profile picture. I expected to be recognised and welcomed in. Nothing. But it turned out anyone could go straight past if they were going to see a movie, so I did that. When I got upstairs I got nervous and someone asked me if I was there to see a film. Panicked, I said yes. They said which film? I panicked again and chose the first thing I saw. That's how I ended up seeing a 32 minute cartoon for children called Superworm about the longest strongest worm. I did not get into the B2Believe event. I was the real worm that day.",

Divorce proceedings can be tough. I'd know, I've been through three of them. You'd think it gets easier. It doesn't. Luckily I found a good distraction. I've been making Clay tables. There's no better distraction than automating growth workflows to turn insights into revenue. No time to cry when you're caring about GTM. That's when I realised Clay are making a World Record Record Book for clay tables. Mine is probably the first Clay table built during a child custody hearing. My divorce lawyer keeps telling me to pay attention. No. I'm locked in. I'm probably losing my kids, but worth it for the ability to act on unique data. hashtag # ClayPartner",

Everyone was talking about Rachel's lunch yesterday. She brought in a lunch that smelled so good it was all people could talk about. I couldn't let it slide. In the office, the boss must be the best at everything. I got my lunch and sprayed it with expensive perfume, and added soap and bath salts. Returning to the kitchen, I waved it in front of them. They had to admit it did smell kind of good. Rachel piped up, jealously, "it smells a bit like your perfume?" "Oh yeah," I said. "If it had my perfume sprayed on it, would I be able to eat it without issue?" I ate the whole thing in front of everybody. I had an awful time that afternoon, but it was worth it to maintain my dominance. They had to concede I was still king of the lunch smell.",

"Sorry you don't have enough experience." I've told this to 300 interview candidates this year. To their face. The truth is: all of them did. "Experience" is simply code. What for? Being hot. I turn down every candidate I don't find 10/10 hot. I don't care about experience, as long as you're pleasing on the eyes. "Not enough experience" = you're ugly. I hired a 6 foot 4 chiselled jaw six-pack abs himbo. He kept trying to use a LCD monitor as a touchscreen. But importantly, he had "experience." Before you apply to any of my jobs, hit the gym.

Yesterday I received a mysterious package at work. Without thinking, I opened it in front of everyone. It was a pair of women's underwear. I went bright red. This was hugely embarrassing. There was a handwritten note from a secret admirer. I was mortified, but my staff laughed it off. They said they didn't realise I was so good with the ladies. I could feel a newfound respect from them. It worked. I sent myself the underwear. Employees work 34% harder when they think their boss is desirable. Fun fact: absolutely anyone can just buy women's underwear online. And the note? I can emulate women's handwriting with ease.",

Very sadly Ken passed away this morning. This is one of Ken's close family members posting on his account. This is a tragedy for not just our family, but all of us. But it is perhaps the greatest tragedy for Ken, who never completed his most treasured goal: Reaching 200,000 followers on LinkedIn. Ken did it all. He: - set up multiple successful businesses - appeared on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list - got disqualified from the Forbes 30 under 30 list because he was actually 35 - had sex the list goes on... But he never hit the golden 200k. If there is one way to honour his memory, it is to follow him so he hits 200k. Please, let us mourn this great handsome brilliant man the only way that seems right.",

5 years ago I witnessed the birth of my youngest child. She was so beautiful. While I watched her sleep I noticed something. The baby next to her in the nursery was the child of the CEO of a huge potential client. My business brain kicked into gear. I switched the two babies' tags. We left with their child, they left with ours. It took the hospital years to discover their mistake. We just did the switch back with the other parents last month. After raising each others' children, we have a life bond stronger than any other. Naturally, we talked about going into business together. Today, we signed the most lucrative deal I've ever made. Making business connections isn't just for adults. It's for newborn babies too.",

Stop everything you're doing. I've discovered this amazing platform HockeyStack . How do I know it's amazing? I don't. They're paying me to say this. I haven't used it nor do I understand what it does. But they're giving me a lot of money to say it's great, so it probably is. It's used in marketing or something - I have no idea. I saw the words "drive pipeline efficiency" in the brief and checked out. Still, it's very important you click on their page and sign up to their website. Why? Because then they might pay me even more money in the future if this post does well. Please. I'm getting sooo much money to say this. Also they seem like cool people who are all smart and fit.

Had to let an employee go last month. A single mother who was an amazing worker. Top 5 hardest thing I’ve ever done. Why did I do it? Because I didn't want her son to grow up without a mother. I overwork my staff, making them stay late and work on weekends. I couldn't do that to her boy. Now she's struggling to find a new job. People have told her "you'll land on your feet." Not if I have anything to say about it. I've given her a terrible reference to all potential new employers. There is no greater or more fulfilling job than being a mother. She'll thank me later for this.",

It's weird there's no LinkedIn for sex. I've been using dating apps recently. You learn so little about someone on there. Compare it to LinkedIn - one look at a profile and I know someone intimately. Dating apps could be more like LinkedIn. Their entire dating history would be on there, as well as relevant qualifications. I'd ask my dates "why is there a gap in your dating resumé between 2017-2019?" You could receive endorsements from all your previous lovers. Mine would look like: - Oral: 25 endorsements - Nipple play: 35 endorsements - Gift Giving: 3 endorsements Nobody is working on this...except me. Get ready to endorse me for Nipple Play.",

I want to everyone to know that I wasn't bothered that it looked like I wet my pants yesterday. I went to the toilet before an important meeting and splashed water on my trousers. It looked exactly like I had peed myself. I categorically did not. However, I want to make clear I did not care it looked like that. Nor was I embarrassed at all when Jennifer pointed it out. I knew in my heart it wasn't urine, so it did not matter what other people thought. Wet or not, I had a meeting to run. The fact people were stifling their chuckles throughout did not affect me even in the tiniest bit. I ran the meeting impeccably. My crotch area doesn't need to be dry for me to be a good boss. I had to let Jennifer go later that afternoon for unrelated reasons.",

I was involved in a car crash last week. My car was t-boned by a drunk driver going 90 miles per hour. It was completely crushed and flipped three times and landed upside down. Glass was everywhere. I was bleeding out. Suddenly my alarm went off. It was the Teams meeting I had scheduled in. I had to deliver a brief detailing a completely new project. I took the call. My fight or flight instincts kicked in. Despite having a shard of glass in my abdomen, I was completely in the zone. If I were to die, this would be the perfect way to spend my last moments on Earth. I was so locked in I ignored a missed call from my kids. Luckily, I survived. I think it was thanks to having something to focus on. I don't care if you're busy. Show up to your Teams meetings. You may save a life.",
